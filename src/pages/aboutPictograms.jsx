        You’ve seen pictograms, even if you didn’t know they were called that.
        Pictograms are drawings or pictures that clearly represent an action or
        abstract concept. They play an important role in children's daily life.
        Whether they are used to illustrate the steps surrounding mealtime,
        naptime, or rules that must be respected.
